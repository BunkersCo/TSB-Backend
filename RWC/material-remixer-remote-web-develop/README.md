[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/material-foundation/material-remixer-remote-web.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/material-foundation/material-remixer-remote-web) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/material-remixer-remote-web.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/material-remixer-remote-web)

The Remixer variables defined in your app can be exposed on a remote controller
website that you can set up using Firebase hosting. The remote controller allows
updating your defined variables, and changes will be propagated in real-time
across associated apps. Share the link to this site with your teammates from
within the Remixer overlay or by emailing them.

If you are interested in using Remixer on another platform, you may want to
check out the [iOS](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-ios),
[Android](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-android),
and [JavaScript](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-js)
repos. You can use this Remote Controller with any of these three platforms to
change the variables from a web dashboard.

## Quickstart

#### 1. Sign up for Firebase.

Remixer remote will work with any new or existing Firebase account. It will use
the [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) feature to
host this remote controller. If you don't have an existing Firebase account you
wish to use, you can signup following instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com).

#### 2. Use [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Run the following script from root of this repo
npm install
```

#### 3. Add your Firebase credentials.

Add your Firebase credentials to the `index.html` file located in the `src`
folder.

```javascript
// TODO: Replace with your project's info.
var config = {
  apiKey: "<API_KEY>",
  authDomain: "<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://<DATABASE_NAME>.firebaseio.com",
};
```

#### 4. Build and deploy the library to your Firebase Hosting account.

Running the following script will generate a new `public` folder first with all
of the required files. It will then copy these files to your Firebase Hosting
storage.

```bash
# Run the following script from root of this repo.
npm run deploy -- --project=<PROJECT_ID>
```

#### 5. Your site is now ready.

The Remixer remote controller will now be available at:
```
https://<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com/<REMOTE_ID>
```
